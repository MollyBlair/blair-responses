<h1>XSLT: Purpose and Uses</h1>
<h2>What is XSLT</h2>
<p>Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSLT) transforms an XML document to an output document (HTML). XSLT takes the data categorized in XML and transforms it into a document visible by a parser (such as a web browser).

<h2>How is XSLT Useful to Technical Communicators</h2>
<p>Many websites contain large amounts of data. If technical communicators input this data into an HTML document, that data would be static on that page. If technical communicators needed to replicate this data, they would need to copy and paste the data into every document. The problem is that in order to change this static data, every instance would need to be edited. If one data entry is missed, this could lead to miainformation. Technical communicators use XML to sort data and XSLT to convert the data to a readable format. Without XSLT, XML is just a list with no format. </p>

<p>XSLT also allows technical communicators to extract data from an XML document. Rather than just formatting all the content of the XML document, technical communicators can pick what needs to be displayed by using XSLT. XSLT can also provide a way for users to sort content on a parser based on their own needs.</p>
