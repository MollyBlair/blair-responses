<h1>Renegotiating with Technology: Training Towards More Sustainable Technical Communication<h1>
<h2>Dave Clark and Rebekka Andersen</h2>

<p>Clark and Andersen argue that technical communicators have become too focused on tools rather than technology. People within their organization see technical communicators as "tool jockeys" who transfer content from one tool to another rather than people who can create and manage content.</p>

<p>Clark and Andersen suggest training technical communicators not to solve client problems, but to identify and design solutions for documentation organization. Technical communicators also need to identify their skill set within an organization to achieve credibility. In order to achieve these goals, Clark and Anderson suggest that technical communication practitioners and students need to involve themselves with organization deliverables and integrate their ideas with other departments - in industry and in university</p>

<p>Therefore, students learning XML shouldn't just learn how to plug in data. Students need to understand how to organize the data and create ways to organize data to make it easier to understand by the end user. The goal is to make technical communication sustainable and prove that technical communicators are knowledge and content management experts: not just content converters.</p>
