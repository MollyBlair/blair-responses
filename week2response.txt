When it comes to the skills technical communicators should possess, general skills are more valuable than specific skills. This seems surprising, but it makes logical sense. For example, I don’t know how to write about medical practices. But as a technical communicator, I can employ some of the most valuable skills according to Rainey and Dayton’s study. By collaborating with a subject matter expert (SME) on medical practices, learning to use the medical practices, and exercising my writing abilities, I can eventually write about medical practices.What did surprise me is that collaboration was ranked the highest in both samples. I expected writing for an audience to be top rated ability. However, being a technical writer who cannot collaborate with SMEs is like being a chef who cannot get ingredients. A chef cannot cook without ingredients; a technical writer cannot write without information from an SME.What surprised me most was that this study was published ten years ago. Technology has changed significantly since 2005. Social media and smartphones impacted technical communication since then. Nevertheless, the findings of this study remain pertinent. Even though technology will change, the most basic skills of a technical communicator (e.g. collaborating with SMEs and coworkers, writing clearly for a defined audience) will not change whereas technology is guaranteed to change. As long as technical writers can adapt to these changes, we will be an asset to companies and users.
