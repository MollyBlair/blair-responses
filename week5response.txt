In his essay on content management, William Hart-Davidson re-defines the role of technical communicators through the rising genre of content management. He defines content management as “a set of practices for handling information, including how it is created, stored, retrieved, formatted, and styled for delivery” (130).The traditional view of a technical writer is someone who coordinates with subject matter experts and writes content. However, now writing is not just a job for a technical writer anymore. The focus shifted to managing content and ensuring every deliverable looks as though was written by one person. This new role interests me. By being a content manager, technical communicators are quality control. As technology continues to expand, content managers ensure that quality content can be added, adapted, or changed across multiple platforms and deliverables.Technical communicators are now managers of content rather than just creators. As user-experience becomes a primary focus, technical communicators must ensure that content is easy to find, edit, and send to users. Content managers also ensure that users are getting the correct content no matter where they look.The value of a technical communicator is shifting away from creating content as field experts are becoming more adept at creating content. Rather, the value of a technical communicator is ensuring that all content submitted meets a quality standard and organizing content to make retrieval and editing easier to avoid mistakes that could confuse or impair a user.Hart-Davidson, W.
