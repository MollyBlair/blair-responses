In his article on single sourcing in professional environments, Albers explains that single sourcing prevents poor construction and misinformation. Albers defines the craftsman model as a model of a model where each person contributes a part of the major project. I can attest that this model does not work for technical documents. In my advanced technical communication class, I worked in a team of three on a site evaluation. We divided the work into sections and submitted the assignment by copying and pasting out sections together. Although our work was acceptable, the styles differed so dramatically that the paper read as it was written: by three people with completely different backgrounds.Single sourcing prevents this problem. Albers suggests we should have experts for each level of a project instead of having technical professionals do a general chunk of the project. Albers highlights the need for specialization for this model to divide the work in a project based on the expertise of the team members.Albers notes that XML has been a successful method for single sourcing, but notes that the success stories are generally for data that does not need to be regularly changed. It may be difficult to change or adapt the data in a large XML file. Even in my smaller XML file, it was at times difficult to find and correct mistakes.Albers suggests a writer hierarchy to avoid resorting to the craftsman model. He divides his model into three levels:* Junior-level writers who produce and write content.* Mid-level writers who transition into management.* Senior-level writers who design models and analyze content.This model ensures that content is added in a uniform model and assessed by senior members.
